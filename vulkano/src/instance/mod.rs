//! API entry point.
//!
//! The first thing to do after loading the Vulkan library is to create an `Instance` object.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use vulkano::{
//!     instance::{Instance, InstanceExtensions},
//!     Version, VulkanLibrary,
//! };
//!
//! let library = VulkanLibrary::new()
//!     .unwrap_or_else(|err| panic!("couldn't load Vulkan library: {:?}", err));
//! let instance = Instance::new(&library, &Default::default())
//!     .unwrap_or_else(|err| panic!("couldn't create instance: {:?}", err));
//! ```
//!
//! Creating an instance initializes everything and allows you to enumerate physical devices,
//! ie. all the Vulkan implementations that are available on the system.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use vulkano::{
//! #     instance::{Instance, InstanceExtensions},
//! #     Version, VulkanLibrary,
//! # };
//! use vulkano::device::physical::PhysicalDevice;
//!
//! # let library = VulkanLibrary::new().unwrap();
//! # let instance = Instance::new(&library, &Default::default()).unwrap();
//! #
//! for physical_device in instance.enumerate_physical_devices().unwrap() {
//!     println!(
//!         "Available device: {}",
//!         physical_device.properties().device_name,
//!     );
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Enumerating physical devices and creating a device
//!
//! After you have created an instance, the next step is usually to enumerate the physical devices
//! that are available on the system with `Instance::enumerate_physical_devices()` (see above).
//!
//! When choosing which physical device to use, keep in mind that physical devices may or may not
//! be able to draw to a certain surface (ie. to a window or a monitor), or may even not be able
//! to draw at all. See the `swapchain` module for more information about surfaces.
//!
//! Once you have chosen a physical device, you can create a `Device` object from it. See the
//! `device` module for more info.
//!
//! # Portability subset devices and the `ENUMERATE_PORTABILITY` flag
//!
//! Certain devices, currently those on MacOS and iOS systems, do not fully conform to the Vulkan
//! specification. They are usable as normal devices, but they do not implement everything that
//! is required; some mandatory parts of Vulkan are missing. These are known as
//! "portability subset" devices.
//!
//! A portability subset device will advertise support for the
//! [`khr_portability_subset`](crate::device::DeviceExtensions::khr_portability_subset) device
//! extension. This extension must always be enabled when it is supported, and Vulkano will
//! automatically enable it when creating the device. When it is enabled, some parts of Vulkan that
//! are available in standard Vulkan will not be available by default, but they can be used by
//! enabling corresponding features when creating the device, if the device supports them.
//!
//! Because these devices are non-conformant, Vulkan programs that rely on full compliance may
//! not work (crash or have validation errors) when run on them, if they happen to use a part of
//! Vulkan that is missing from the non-conformant device. Therefore, Vulkan hides them from
//! the user by default when calling `enumerate_physical_devices` on the instance. If there are no
//! conformant devices on the system, `Instance::new` will return an `IncompatibleDriver` error.
//!
//! In order to enumerate portability subset devices, you must set the
//! [`InstanceCreateFlags::ENUMERATE_PORTABILITY`] flag when creating the instance. However, if you
//! do this, your program must be prepared to handle the non-conformant aspects of these devices,
//! and must enable the appropriate features when creating the `Device` if you intend to use them.

/// An instance of a Vulkan context. This is the main object that should be created by an
/// application before everything else.
///
/// # Application and engine info
///
/// When you create an instance, you have the possibility to set information about your application
/// and its engine.
///
/// Providing this information allows for example the driver to let the user configure the driver's
/// behavior for your application alone through a control panel.
///
/// ```no_run
/// # #[macro_use]
/// # extern crate vulkano;
/// #
/// # fn main() {
/// use vulkano::{
///     instance::{Instance, InstanceCreateInfo, InstanceExtensions},
///     Version, VulkanLibrary,
/// };
///
/// let library = VulkanLibrary::new().unwrap();
/// let _instance =
///     Instance::new(&library, &InstanceCreateInfo::application_from_cargo_toml()).unwrap();
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// # API versions
///
/// Both an `Instance` and a [`Device`](crate::device::Device) have a highest version of the Vulkan
/// API that they support. This places a limit on what Vulkan functions and features are available
/// to use when used on a particular instance or device. It is possible for the instance and the
/// device to support different versions. The supported version for an instance can be queried
/// before creation with
/// [`VulkanLibrary::api_version`],
/// while for a device it can be retrieved with
/// [`PhysicalDevice::api_version`].
///
/// When creating an `Instance`, you have to specify a maximum API version that you will use.
/// This restricts the API version that is available for the instance and any devices created from
/// it. For example, if both instance and device potentially support Vulkan 1.2, but you specify
/// 1.1 as the maximum API version when creating the `Instance`, then you can only use Vulkan 1.1
/// functions, even though they could theoretically support a higher version. You can think of it
/// as a promise never to use any functionality from a higher version.
///
/// The maximum API version is not a _minimum_, so it is possible to set it to a higher version
/// than what the instance or device inherently support. The final API version that you are able to
/// use on an instance or device is the lower of the supported API version and the chosen maximum
/// API version of the `Instance`.
///
/// Due to a quirk in how the Vulkan 1.0 specification was written, if the instance only
/// supports Vulkan 1.0, then it is not possible to specify a maximum API version higher than 1.0.
/// Trying to create an `Instance` will return an `IncompatibleDriver` error. Consequently, it is
/// not possible to use a higher device API version with an instance that only supports 1.0.
///
/// # Extensions
///
/// When creating an `Instance`, you must provide a list of extensions that must be enabled on the
/// newly-created instance. Trying to enable an extension that is not supported by the system will
/// result in an error.
///
/// Contrary to OpenGL, it is not possible to use the features of an extension if it was not
/// explicitly enabled.
///
/// Extensions are especially important to take into account if you want to render images on the
/// screen, as the only way to do so is to use the `VK_KHR_surface` extension. More information
/// about this in the `swapchain` module.
///
/// For example, here is how we create an instance with the `VK_KHR_surface` and
/// `VK_KHR_android_surface` extensions enabled, which will allow us to render images to an
/// Android screen. You can compile and run this code on any system, but it is highly unlikely to
/// succeed on anything else than an Android-running device.
///
/// ```no_run
/// use vulkano::{
///     instance::{Instance, InstanceCreateInfo, InstanceExtensions},
///     Version, VulkanLibrary,
/// };
///
/// let library = VulkanLibrary::new()
///     .unwrap_or_else(|err| panic!("couldn't load Vulkan library: {:?}", err));
///
/// let extensions = InstanceExtensions {
///     khr_surface: true,
///     khr_android_surface: true,
///     ..InstanceExtensions::empty()
/// };
///
/// let instance = Instance::new(
///     &library,
///     &InstanceCreateInfo {
///         enabled_extensions: &extensions,
///         ..Default::default()
///     },
/// )
/// .unwrap_or_else(|err| panic!("couldn't create instance: {:?}", err));
/// ```
///
/// # Layers
///
/// When creating an `Instance`, you have the possibility to pass a list of **layers** that will
/// be activated on the newly-created instance. The list of available layers can be retrieved by
/// calling the [`layer_properties`](VulkanLibrary::layer_properties) method of
/// `VulkanLibrary`.
///
/// A layer is a component that will hook and potentially modify the Vulkan function calls.
/// For example, activating a layer could add a frames-per-second counter on the screen, or it
/// could send information to a debugger that will debug your application.
///
/// > **Note**: From an application's point of view, layers "just exist". In practice, on Windows
/// > and Linux, layers can be installed by third party installers or by package managers and can
/// > also be activated by setting the value of the `VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS` environment variable
/// > before starting the program. See the documentation of the official Vulkan loader for these
/// > platforms.
///
/// > **Note**: In practice, the most common use of layers right now is for debugging purposes.
/// > To do so, you are encouraged to set the `VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS` environment variable on Windows
/// > or Linux instead of modifying the source code of your program. For example:
/// > `export VK_INSTANCE_LAYERS=VK_LAYER_LUNARG_api_dump` on Linux if you installed the Vulkan SDK
/// > will print the list of raw Vulkan function calls.
///
/// ## Examples
///
/// ```
/// # use std::{sync::Arc, error::Error};
/// # use vulkano::{
/// #     instance::{Instance, InstanceCreateInfo, InstanceExtensions},
/// #     Version, VulkanLibrary,
/// # };
/// #
/// # fn test() -> Result<Arc<Instance>, Box<dyn Error>> {
/// let library = VulkanLibrary::new()?;
///
/// // For the sake of the example, we activate all the layers that
/// // contain the word "foo" in their description.
/// let layers: Vec<_> = library
///     .layer_properties()?
///     .filter(|l| l.description().contains("foo"))
///     .collect();
///
/// let instance = Instance::new(
